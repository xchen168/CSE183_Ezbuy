                                                                          Implementation of Ezbuy
  This project is made by Xiao Chen and Hao Qian. Ezbuy is a website built for university students to sell and trade their useless stuff. We implemented many features for Ezbuy to make it very easy for students to use. Our inspiration comes from “Offerup”, a local buy-sell app that allows people to buy and sell their second hand items. Many of the second hand items come with lower prices which are good for students in university because they do not have a lot of money. 
Below is our implementation for the website each will be explained in detail:

Search bar - From the search bar, we can enter any keyword, so we can search the database from the controller. This is a very useful feature because you can find what you like in a fast way. The user doesn't need to go down the list and check everything on the website.

Upload item - This feature can help students to upload a picture that presents their item. For people who want to sell the stuff they don’t want or it is unnecessary, they can upload the item into Ezbuy. The user can add the name,price, and quantity in their upload page which is very useful in a trading website.

Buy item - According to the ID of the thing we need to buy, we will have two ways: get and post. If the product does not exist, it will return to the main interface. If it does exist, it will jump to the payment interface

 Description box- There is a description box for the seller to fill in the corresponding description of the item, including the old and new degree of the item, whether the item still exists, and whether someone intends to buy it. The price, quantity, name and description of the item are stored in the database

Personal page - In this page people can see what item they have uploaded. Also you can change your password using this page. It is used for users to keep track of what they have bought in the past.
